This is my java assignment - 4 .
The src repository contains two .java files AccountOverdrawDemo and AccountOverdrawSafeDemo.
Both classes have main methods.
Both have classes their own account and person classes.
Run the main method in both files to and you will find that main method of AccountOverdrawDemo fails to
keep record of remaining balance in the account while main method of AccountOverdrawSafeDemo is able to do that succesfully.

There are two person objects namely Husband and Wife both have same Account object linked to them.
Both the objects try to withdraw money from the account and when money is withdrawn a command line 
message of remaining balance is shown.

AccountOverdrawSafeDemo is able to do to show remaning balance succesfully.
AccountOverdrawDemo is not able to show remaining balance succesfully.
